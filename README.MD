Using FastNoiseLite, Irrlicht and Qt to visualise 3D ridged noise.

This is not an optimised version using threads. That is still to come. Plus I want to utilise threading when animating the ridge noise using 4D.

If you are using this to test out then you will probably need a mesh file (my one is included) which is .5 of the scale of the default blender cube size.
